# About
 This command line interface application will generate a webpage that displays a team's basic info so that you can have quick access to team member's information such as emails and GitHub profiles
## Installation
The dependencies are, [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.
## Usage
Users will enter 'node app.js' in the CLI to initalize the app
Users will be prompted to enter information about the Team Manager.

After entering information about the Team Manager users are prompted to;
    add additional team members
        add information about the Intern
        add information about the Engineer
    select 'none. Create my Team!'

Upon selecting 'none' and creating the team, users will see that a 'output' folder has been generated and a 'team.html' file has been created that dynamically displays information about yor team.



## Test Instructions
This app has not been validated to not accept junk values in the input fields. This will be revised in the future.
